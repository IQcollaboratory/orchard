A major goal of the IQ Collaboratory is the apples to apples comparison of isolated & quiescent galaxies across observations and simulations. To do so, we have developed `Orchard`, a framework for creating mock surveys from simulated volumes.

`Orchard` is currently set up to create SDSS-like surveys from large volume, hydrodynamical simulations. However, the framework is flexible and can be adjusted based on the desired input (semi-analytic models, zoom-in simulations) and output (other surveys such LSST or DESI).

This package is currently intended for IQ internal use. If you are interested in adapting `Orchard` for your own work, please get in touch with Claire Dickey (http://clairedickey.com).
